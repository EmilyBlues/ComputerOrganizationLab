2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cu/O212[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cu/out_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell cu/out_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pc/O102[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pc/ExtSel_reg_i_2/O, cell pc/ExtSel_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	CLK_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to T17
	CLK_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT cu/out_reg[7]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 7 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    mp32/out_reg[1] {LDCE}
    mp32/out_reg[2] {LDCE}
    mp32/out_reg[3] {LDCE}
    mp32/out_reg[4] {LDCE}
    mp32/out_reg[5] {LDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT pc/ExtSel_reg_i_2 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    cu/ALUOp_reg[0] {LDCE}
    cu/ALUOp_reg[1] {LDCE}
    cu/ALUOp_reg[2] {LDCE}
    cu/ALUSrcB_reg {LDCE}
    cu/DBDataSrc_reg {LDCE}
